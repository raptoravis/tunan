# Shipping Workflow

This file contains the shipping workflow (Phase 3-4). It is loaded when all Phase 2 tasks are complete and execution transitions to quality check.

## Phase 3: Quality Check

1. **Run Core Quality Checks**

   Always run before submitting:

   ```bash
   # Run full test suite (use project's test command)
   # Examples: bin/rails test, npm test, pytest, go test, etc.

   # Run linting (per AGENTS.md)
   # Use linting-agent before pushing to origin
   ```

2. **Simplify** (conditional — separate from code review tiers)

   Before code review, invoke **`simplify-code`** when the diff is non-mechanical and large enough to benefit (default: **>=30 changed lines**). Skip when the diff is purely mechanical (formatting, dependency bumps, lint-only fixes, generated artifacts).

   This step refines reuse, quality, and efficiency on the **current diff** so any later review sees cleaner code. It is not a substitute for Tier 1 or Tier 2 review.

   Pass `plan:<path>` or a scope hint when the plan or user narrowed what changed. If the skill is unavailable on the harness, skip or do a brief manual pass for obvious duplicate/dead code — do not escalate to Tier 2 because simplify was skipped.

3. **Code Review**

   Use **Tier 1** when the harness provides a built-in review. Use **Tier 2** only when escalation criteria below match — **not** because Tier 1 is missing.

   **Tier 1 -- harness-native review (default when available).** Run the harness built-in code review (e.g., `/review` in Claude Code). Address blocking and suggested findings inline before Final Validation. Skip the Residual Work Gate.

   **Tier 2 -- `code-review` (escalation only).** Two steps — **review is not fix.**

   **2a. Review (read-only).** Invoke `code-review` with `mode:agent` (and `plan:<path>` when known; add `base:<ref>` when the diff base is already resolved). Parse JSON or Actionable Findings. Do not pass `mode:autofix`.

   **2b. Apply fixes (caller-owned).** Load `references/review-findings-followup.md`: filter on JSON, batch by file, dispatch fix subagents. Orchestrator merges, tests, commits. Then proceed to the Residual Work Gate.

   **When Tier 1 is unavailable and Tier 2 criteria are not met:** skip a dedicated review step. Phase 2 testing, simplify (when run), lint, and Final Validation still apply. Note in the shipping summary: `Code review: skipped (no Tier 1 tool; Tier 2 criteria not met).`

   Escalate to Tier 2 when **any** of the following is true:
   - **Sensitive surface touched.** The diff modifies any of: authentication or authorization, payments or billing, data migrations or backfills, cryptography or secret handling, security-relevant configuration, public API or library contracts, or dependency manifests.
   - **Large and diffuse change.** The diff exceeds >=400 changed lines **and** spans more than 3 directories or 2 distinct subsystems. Either alone is a soft signal; together they are an escalation trigger.
   - **Very large change.** The diff exceeds >=1,000 changed lines regardless of diffusion.
   - **Plan or task explicitly requests it.** The plan, the originating task, or another instruction in scope calls for a full / deep / thorough code review.

   When the change is small, concentrated, and outside the sensitive surface list, Tier 1 is sufficient -- do not escalate "to be safe."

4. **Residual Work Gate** (REQUIRED when Tier 2 ran)

   After Tier 2 code review and review-findings followup, inspect the **Actionable Findings** summary (or read the run artifact at `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/tunan/tunan:code-review/<run-id>/` if the summary was truncated). If one or more actionable `downstream-resolver` findings were not applied in followup, do not proceed to Final Validation until they are resolved or durably recorded.

   **Non-interactive / autonomous sessions (no human can answer — e.g. an `lfg`-style pipeline or a headless run):** do **not** call the blocking tool — that would hang the pipeline. After step 3b auto-applied every mechanically-eligible finding, take the `Accept and proceed` path automatically: record the remaining actionable residuals verbatim to the durable Known Residuals sink (the PR description's Known Residuals section, or a `tunan:review` issue on the no-PR path) and continue to Final Validation. Residuals are recorded, never dropped — this keeps autonomous shipping unblocked without losing findings.

   **Interactive sessions:** Ask the user using the platform's blocking question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code with `ToolSearch select:AskUserQuestion` pre-loaded if needed, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini, `ask_user` in Pi (requires the `pi-ask-user` extension)). Fall back to numbered options in chat only when the harness genuinely lacks a blocking tool. Never silently skip the gate.

   Stem: `Code review left N actionable finding(s) not yet fixed. How should the agent proceed?`

   Options (four or fewer, self-contained labels):
   - `Apply/fix now` — load `references/review-findings-followup.md`, dispatch batched fix subagents for remaining eligible findings, run tests, commit if needed; optionally re-run `code-review` only after the diff changed materially.
   - `File tickets via project tracker` — load `references/tracker-defer.md` in Interactive mode; the agent files tickets in the project's detected tracker (or `gh` fallback, or leaves them in the report if no sink exists) and proceeds to Final Validation.
   - `Accept and proceed` — record the residual findings verbatim in a durable "Known Residuals" sink before shipping. The durable sink is always a GitHub artifact, never a local file. If a PR will be created or updated in Phase 4, include them in the PR description's "Known Residuals" section (the agent owns this when calling `commit-push-pr`). If the user later chooses the no-PR `commit` path, run the GH preflight (`gh` installed; `gh auth status` exits 0; `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` resolves — abort and report the gh setup problem rather than writing a local file if any check fails), ensure the `tunan:review` label exists (`gh label list --search "tunan:review"`, then if absent `gh label create "tunan:review" --color 1f883d --description "tunan review"`), write the accepted findings and source review-run context to an OS temp file (`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` / `$env:TEMP`), and create the issue titled `[review] <branch-or-head-sha>`:

     ```bash
     gh issue create --title "[review] <branch-or-head-sha>" --label "tunan:review" --body-file <tmpfile>
     ```

     When the related feature issue (carrying the plan comment) is known, reference it with `#<N>` in the issue body and also post the findings as a comment on that feature issue (`gh issue comment <N> --body-file <tmpfile>`). Mention the resulting `tunan:review` issue number/URL in the final summary. The user has acknowledged the risk, but the findings must not live only in the transient session.
   - `Stop — do not ship` — abort the shipping workflow. The user will handle findings manually before re-invoking.

   Skip this gate entirely when the review reported `Actionable findings: none.` (and followup applied everything mechanical) or when only Tier 1 was used. Do not proceed past this gate on an `Accept and proceed` decision until the agent has recorded whether the durable sink is `PR Known Residuals` (when a PR exists) or a `tunan:review` issue (when no PR). Never a local file.

5. **Final Validation**
   - All tasks marked completed
   - Testing addressed -- tests pass and new/changed behavior has corresponding test coverage (or an explicit justification for why tests are not needed)
   - Linting passes
   - Code follows existing patterns
   - Figma designs match (if applicable)
   - No console errors or warnings
   - If the plan has a `Requirements` section (or legacy `Requirements Trace`), verify each requirement is satisfied by the completed work
   - If any `Deferred to Implementation` questions were noted, confirm they were resolved during execution

6. **Prepare Operational Validation Plan** (REQUIRED)
   - Add a `## Post-Deploy Monitoring & Validation` section to the PR description for every change.
   - Include concrete:
     - Log queries/search terms
     - Metrics or dashboards to watch
     - Expected healthy signals
     - Failure signals and rollback/mitigation trigger
     - Validation window and owner
   - If there is truly no production/runtime impact, still include the section with: `No additional operational monitoring required` and a one-line reason.

## Phase 4: Ship It

1. **Prepare Evidence Context**

   Do not invoke `demo-reel` directly in this step. Evidence capture belongs to the PR creation or PR description update flow, where the final PR diff and description context are available.

   Note whether the completed work has observable behavior (UI rendering, CLI output, API/library behavior with a runnable example, generated artifacts, or workflow output). The `commit-push-pr` skill will ask whether to capture evidence only when evidence is possible.

2. **Mark the Plan Shipped**

   Record that the plan shipped on the **feature issue `#N`**. The plan is a
   comment on the feature issue, not a local file — run the GH preflight
   (gh installed, `gh auth status` exits 0, `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`
   resolves) before touching it; if any check fails, abort and report the gh
   setup problem rather than writing a local file. Read
   `references/comment-chain-storage.md` for the comment-chain model and
   gh recipes.

   Post a completion note as a fresh comment on the feature issue and (when
   the project closes feature issues on ship) close the issue:

   ```bash
   gh issue comment <N> --body "Implementation complete; shipped."
   ```

   Do not edit the plan comment itself — the plan is a decision artifact and
   carries no `status` field to flip. Whether the work shipped is derived
   from git and the feature issue's PR / close state, not from a mutable
   field in the plan comment.

3. **Commit and Create Pull Request**

   Load the `commit-push-pr` skill to handle committing, pushing, and PR creation. The skill handles convention detection, branch safety, logical commit splitting, adaptive PR descriptions, and attribution badges.

   When providing context for the PR description, include:
   - The plan's summary and key decisions
   - Testing notes (tests added/modified, manual testing performed)
   - Evidence context from step 1, so `commit-push-pr` can decide whether to ask about capturing evidence
   - Figma design link (if applicable)
   - The Post-Deploy Monitoring & Validation section (see Phase 3 Step 6)
   - Any "Known Residuals" accepted in the Phase 3 Residual Work Gate, rendered as a dedicated section in the PR body with severity, file:line, and title per finding

   If the user prefers to commit without creating a PR, load the `commit` skill instead.

4. **Notify User**
   - Summarize what was completed
   - Link to PR (if one was created)
   - Note any follow-up work needed
   - Suggest next steps if applicable

5. **Hand Off to Compound**

   On a successful ship, hand off to the `compound` skill to capture
   the solved problem. Compound writes a `tunan:solution` **comment** on
   the **same feature issue** (marker `<!-- tunan:solution -->`, label
   `tunan:solution`) — not a separate issue and not a local file. Pass it
   the **feature issue `#N`** so the solution comment lives alongside the
   requirement body and plan comment:

   - Provide `compound` the **feature issue ref** (`#<N>`/URL), the PR link,
     and a short summary of what was built.
   - `compound` runs its own GH preflight, writes the `tunan:solution`
     comment onto the feature issue, and adds the `tunan:solution` label.
   - Record the feature issue number/URL in the final summary.

## Code Review Tiers

**Tier 1** when the harness has built-in review. **Tier 2** (`code-review` + followup) only when escalation criteria match — missing Tier 1 is not a reason to escalate.

**Tier 1 -- harness-native review.** Built-in command or skill (e.g., `/review`). Fix findings inline.

**Tier 2 -- `code-review` (escalation).** (2a) Review-only via `mode:agent`. (2b) Batched fix subagents per `references/review-findings-followup.md`; residuals → Residual Work Gate.

**Skip dedicated review** when no Tier 1 and Tier 2 criteria not met (document in summary).

Escalate to Tier 2 when **any** of the following is true:

- **Sensitive surface touched.** The diff modifies any of: authentication or authorization, payments or billing, data migrations or backfills, cryptography or secret handling, security-relevant configuration, public API or library contracts, or dependency manifests.
- **Large and diffuse change.** The diff exceeds >=400 changed lines **and** spans more than 3 directories or 2 distinct subsystems. Either alone is a soft signal; together they are an escalation trigger.
- **Very large change.** The diff exceeds >=1,000 changed lines regardless of diffusion.
- **Plan or task explicitly requests it.** The plan, the originating task, or another instruction in scope calls for a full / deep / thorough code review.
